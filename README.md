Planets is an application which uses a scrollable-tabbed layout to display information about all the planets in the solar system. It is currently in BETA and I am looking for testers across the board. If your interested please join the Google+ community [here](https://plus.google.com/communities/105711742765525315663). Once you've joined, you'll find the link to the testing sign up. There you can become a tester and then head over to the listing on Google Play and dowload the app. **YOU MUST CLICK BECOME A TESTER FIRST! Otherwise if you head to the listing before becoming one, you'll get a 404 error.** After you've downloaded the app, please head back to the Play Store and leave a review as well as a +1. If you would like to become a contributer to my app, please do a pull request and contact me before you make changes. **Also note that some of the planet details have not been filled in completely. That is because the app is in BETA and is still in the works.** Try not to mention that in ratings because I'm fuly aware of it.

A Google Play link will be here soon once the app makes production.

Thank you,
